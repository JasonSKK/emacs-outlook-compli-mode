The following processes will be replaced by variables shortly but for now:
1. Edit "YOURNAME" with your name line 78.
2. Set "outlook-address1" with your email line 90

;; This Emacs major mode allows users to send emails through Microsoft
;; Outlook by utilising simple osa-scripting (MacOs only) and you need
;; the Outlook application therefore.  It eliminates the need for
;; using fake email client IDs, making it ideal for those who wish to
;; maintain compliance with organisation regulations.  With this mode,
;; users can automate the process of composing and sending emails from
;; within Emacs.

;; What this mode does NOT do:
;; DOES NOT communicate with outlook/exchange server in any way.
;; DOES NOT Fetch and read email yet (todo)
;; DOES NOT Send Attachments
;; DOES NOT Support text signature
;; DOES NOT do many more
