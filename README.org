**Note: I no longer maintain this package, as I have fully transitioned to using Debian and no longer require it. Please feel free to fork the repository and update the code as needed. Outlook and macOS have likely changed significantly since I last worked on this mode. You are welcome to adapt and improve it to suit your use case.**

* Introduction

This Emacs major mode allows users to send emails through Microsoft Outlook by utilising simple osa-scripting (MacOs only) and you need the Outlook application therefore.  It eliminates the need for using fake email client IDs, making it ideal for those who wish to maintain compliance with organisation regulations.  With this mode, users can automate the process of composing and sending emails from within Emacs.

* Setup
To use the outlook-message-send function, you need to edit two variables in the code with your name and email address.
To do this, look for the following two lines of code in the file:

#+BEGIN_SRC
;; set primary address
(setq outlook-address1 "youremail@example.co.uk")
(setq outlook-name1 "YOUR NAME")

;; set emacs archive directory, where csv is saved
(setq emacs-outlook-compli-archive-directory "/path/to/outlook-mail")
#+END_SRC

Replace "youremail@example.co.uk" with your email address and "YOUR NAME" with your name, and  "/path/to/outlook-mail" for the directory where emails will be stored.

Then, if the outlook-mail dir does not exist, create it, for example
#+BEGIN_SRC
mkdir ~/outlook-mail
#+END_SRC

For now make sure it is called "outlook-mail" this will be fixed in the future.

* Limitations
What this mode does NOT do:
+ DOES NOT communicate with outlook/exchange server in any way.
+ DOES NOT Fetch and read email yet (under development)
+ DOES NOT Send Attachments
+ DOES NOT Support text signature
+ DOES NOT do many more
* Script Attribution

The following scripts were originally created by Moth Software and retrieved on May 1st, 2023, from the [[https://www.mothsoftware.com/][Moth Software]] Blog:

- "Exporting emails from Outlook with AppleScript" -- outlook-compli-export-list-outlook-emails.scpt
- "How to print a list of selected emails in Outlook" -- emacs-outlook-compli-fetch-email.scpt

I have slightly adapted these scripts to suit my project's needs. However, the core functionality and credit for the original ideas remain with [[https://www.mothsoftware.com/][Moth Software]] and the author Beatrix Willius.
