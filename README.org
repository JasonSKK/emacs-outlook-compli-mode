* Introduction

This Emacs major mode allows users to send emails through Microsoft Outlook by utilising simple osa-scripting (MacOs only) and you need the Outlook application therefore.  It eliminates the need for using fake email client IDs, making it ideal for those who wish to maintain compliance with organisation regulations.  With this mode, users can automate the process of composing and sending emails from within Emacs.

* Setup
To use the outlook-message-send function, you need to edit two variables in the code with your name and email address.
To do this, look for the following two lines of code in the file:

#+BEGIN_SRC
(setq outlook-address1 "youremail@example.co.uk")
(setq outlook-name1 "YOUR NAME")
#+END_SRC

Replace "youremail@example.co.uk" with your email address and "YOUR NAME" with your name.

* Limitations
What this mode does NOT do:
+ DOES NOT communicate with outlook/exchange server in any way.
+ DOES NOT Fetch and read email yet (todo)
+ DOES NOT Send Attachments
+ DOES NOT Support text signature
+ DOES NOT do many more
